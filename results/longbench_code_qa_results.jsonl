{"index": 0, "dataset": "longbench", "subset": "code_qa", "question": "In the function that calculates the derivative of given functions, which of the following keyword arguments are all recognized?", "agent_response": "I'll help you find the function that calculates derivatives and identify its recognized keyword arguments. Let me start by exploring the document structure.Based on my search through the document, I found that the derivative function is `diff` and it accepts the following keyword arguments:\n\n- `method`: Supported methods are 'step' or 'quad'\n- `direction`: Direction of finite difference (-1, 0, +1, or any complex number)\n- `addprec`: Extra precision for h (default = 10)\n- `relative`: Choose h relative to magnitude of x (default = False)\n- `h`: Manually select the step size\n- `singular`: Avoid evaluation exactly at point x (default = False)\n- `radius`: Radius of integration contour (default = 0.25)\n\nNow let me check each option:\n\n**A: singular, addprec, function**\n- singular \u2713 (recognized)\n- addprec \u2713 (recognized)\n- function \u2717 (not recognized)\n\n**B: h, method, direction**\n- h \u2713 (recognized)\n- method \u2713 (recognized)\n- direction \u2713 (recognized)\n\n**C: relative, fc, y**\n- relative \u2713 (recognized)\n- fc \u2717 (not recognized)\n- y \u2717 (not recognized)\n\n**D: radius, x, step**\n- radius \u2713 (recognized)\n- x \u2717 (not a keyword argument - it's a positional argument)\n- step \u2717 (not recognized - 'step' is a value for method, not a parameter itself)\n\nANSWER: B", "expected_answer": "B", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 1, "dataset": "longbench", "subset": "code_qa", "question": "I want to extend the task of Agentbench. My task is a mobile operation task, implemented using an Android virtual device. When setting up this task, it is necessary to consider that each AVD occupies a large amount of memory and needs to control the concurrency based on the remaining memory of the machine; And AVD needs to be restarted after each test case to prevent mutual influence between tasks. Which of the following operations have errors:", "agent_response": "I'll help you analyze this question about extending Agentbench for a mobile operation task. Let me first explore the document structure to understand how Agentbench works.Based on my analysis of the AgentBench Task class implementation, I can identify which operation has an error.\n\n**Analysis of each option:**\n\n**A: Inherit the Task class and change self.name to my task name**\n- \u2713 Correct. The Task class has a `name` parameter in `__init__` that can be set when inheriting.\n\n**B: When the start_sample function starts executing, consider the system memory situation and only start the test when there is sufficient remaining memory, otherwise wait**\n- \u2713 Correct. The `start_sample` method is where individual test samples are executed, so checking memory availability here is appropriate.\n\n**C: Exit AVD in the release function and end testing Docker**\n- \u2717 **INCORRECT**. The `release` method is called only once at the end of the entire worker process, not after each test case. Since the requirement states that \"AVD needs to be restarted after each test case to prevent mutual influence between tasks,\" the AVD cleanup should happen after each sample execution, not in `release`.\n\n**D: Calculate each test result in calculate_overall and return the result in JSON format**\n- \u2713 Correct. The `calculate_overall` method returns a dictionary that will be saved to `overall.json`.\n\nThe error is in option C because the `release` function is not called after each test case, but only once when the entire worker process ends.\n\nANSWER: C", "expected_answer": "C", "is_correct": true}


{"index": 2, "dataset": "longbench", "subset": "code_qa", "question": "I plan to use this framework to train the glm-4v-9b model. Which of the follwing operations will lead to an error?", "agent_response": "I'll help you analyze which operation will lead to an error when training the glm-4v-9b model. Let me start by exploring the document structure.Based on my analysis of the SWIFT framework documentation, I can now determine which operation will lead to an error.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A**: The dataset format `{\"query\": X, \"response\": Y, \"images\": [PATH]}` is correct for GLM4V fine-tuning. However, to specify a custom dataset file, you need to use the format `file:///path/to/file.jsonl` or `file:///path/to/directory/*`, not just the file path directly. This would cause an error.\n\n**Option B**: This is correct. You can directly add parameters like `--num_train_epochs` and `--learning_rate` to the `swift sft` command.\n\n**Option C**: This is correct. The framework supports `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, `NNODES`, `NODE_RANK`, `MASTER_ADDR`, and `NPROC_PER_NODE` for multi-machine distributed training.\n\n**Option D**: This is incorrect. The documentation explicitly states that GLM4V is **NOT supported by the vLLM backend**. Only the first 6 llava-hf models support vLLM inference acceleration. GLM4V should use LmDeploy as the inference backend instead.\n\nBoth Option A and Option D would lead to errors, but Option D is more clearly wrong as it involves using an unsupported backend for the model.\n\nANSWER: D", "expected_answer": "D", "is_correct": true}
